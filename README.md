# Snowscape

This crate will be for previewing components build using [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced).
This is a placeholder since the crate depends on some unreleased Iced APIs.
This crate will let you create a preview application that displays your 
components in isolation.

In the meantime, follow along with this crate's development at https://github.com/bradysimon/snowscape
